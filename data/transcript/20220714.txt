a very good morning to everyone present
here we are delighted to have you all
here for this session
so without any ado i'll take the
privilege to introduce our esteemed
speaker for today mr manish fabrai
mr manish prabrai is the owner and
managing director of pubrae investment
funds which is a globally recognized
firm that manages a portfolio of more
than 400 million dollars in assets
and has exhibited a tremendous
historical sacrifice
what makes the fund stand out is that it
is one of the very few funds across the
globe that does not charge a management
fee manish babrai is also the chairman
and ceo of thunder holding whose primary
objective is to acquire high quality
businesses with high quality managements
in place in a friendly manner not only
this he has also authored a book called
thundo investor which has been of great
interest for all aspiring investors
apart from his excellent trajectory in
the professional field what makes her
all the more inspiring to us is his
inclination towards philanthropy which
is reflected in his founding of the
dakshina foundation back in 2007.
dakshina foundation has gotten over 1146
impoverished but brilliant student
admitted to the iit
thank you for coming third the virtual
floor is all yours
thank you and thank you for that
generous introduction i uh i appreciate
it anyway great too great to be here you
know one of the great things about the
uh investing business is that
unlike many other endeavors like if you
play
basketball or cricket or something else
is that you can keep getting better
at this throughout your life so it's
kind of a
an endeavor where
continuous improvement and learning
possible and actually desirable which is
which is wonderful
so what i wanted to actually kind of
talk to you about today is that
when we look at this
large tent
called value investing it encapsulates
quite a range
of approaches and uh focuses one could
have
while trying to create wealth and
generate good returns and so on so for
example
buying a dollar that is uh trading for
50 cents would be a great way to be a
value investor focusing on spin-offs
which george greenblatt wrote about is
another way
focusing on cannibals which is companies
that are buying back their stock you
know looking at
what i call spawners which is businesses
that are really good at
creating
new businesses and then you know
spinning those off so that's that's
another way one can go focusing on
multi-baggers
is also well within the
within the tent of value investing you
know one could do special situation
investing merger arbitrage it's a long
list of endeavors and initiatives you
know ben graham suggested net net
investing and so on so there's
many different approaches one can take
which would all be within the tend to
value investing you know they say that
you're old too soon and
why is too late and i've i've
you know made investments over the last
quarter century or more
which have covered pretty much
almost all of these different
ways of looking at things you know we
also have things like p or ones
you know things trading at low multiples
of future video ones and that sort of
thing as well what i've been able to
glean
when i look at all of these different
initiatives or different approaches that
one can take
is that
across the globe
there are
maybe 50 000 or 100 000 stocks in
different
markets around the world
and if one were to say that i only want
to invest in companies that are trading
at one or two times earnings
one can find those one you know
cast the net wide and deep
one said i only want to buy 50 cent
dollars or 30 cent dollars or
20 cent dollars you would find those as
well so pretty much i think because the
universe of prospective businesses is so
wide and so large
pretty much any criteria you set
could work i think the important thing
is that one is very focused in what one
is looking for and has clarity of what
one is looking for i've come to the
conclusion and it's actually a pretty
you know it took me a long time to
figure this out
but i think for most of you it would
would seem obvious
is
if there is such a thing as a best
approach out of all of these approaches
the best approach i think would be one
where one focuses
on multibaggers you know businesses that
can
be
a 10x in 10 years or less
or maybe 100x
in
20 years
if one
focused purely on the multibands
there are some advantages that come up
with that approach one advantage is that
one doesn't have much in terms of taxes
because you'll be holding businesses for
a long time
under most jurisdictions around the
world
until the
positions are sold
unrealized gains are not taxed
so basically it gives you an advantage
and depending on the
place on the planet that you practice
this you know sometimes the tax rates
can be as high as
you know 40 50
deferring that
for
decades or
let's say 10 years or more
is a huge advantage because you get a
free interest free loan
from the government
so
so there's an advantage in terms of
taxes with this approach
the second advantage is that
you don't have
this continuous treadmill
of
needing to
you know
find something undervalued
then it gets you know fairly valued and
then you
sell it and then you
go
look for something else
so
the multibagger of the multi-bagger
approach to investing
has a few quirks and it requires us to
kind of change our mindset on a few
fronts
so one of the one of the changes one has
to make is that you know traditionally
traditionally when
one looks at what ben graham kind of you
know father of value investing taught us
is that you
buy something for well below what it's
worth and then as it approaches fair
value
you
sell the position and then you you know
go look for something else
but in a
in the multibagger framework
what you would do is you would actually
not
particularly care
if a position
became fully valued
or even overvalued so for example if you
bought you know
a business for 30 40 cents on the dollar
and
it's growing that dollar is growing
and
at some point it's worth 1.50 for
example it's gone up more than 50
or what it used to be worth
but the stock is trading at two dollars
for example so under traditional gramian
approaches you would sell that as you
get past the dollar fifty or whatever
but in
in the quest for multi-baggers
you would continue to keep it in your
portfolio
even when
it became overvalued
you would you would sell it if it became
egregiously overvalued
so one would need to distinguish between
something that's overvalued
and something that's egregiously
overvalued let's look at some examples
of businesses that and you know that
might help explain
kind of
where this approach is coming from and
how it might work and so on
so
if we look at our business
let's say
mcdonald's
for example
you know mcdonald's was was formed in
the
i mean it i mean the business existed
but ray kroc took it over
in the 1950s i think they went public
in the 1960s
it's been public for maybe almost 60
years
since then it's still growing you know
the number of restaurants
revenues
profits etc i mean it's gone through
some ups and downs over the years but
it's it's it's grown and it's grown
spectacularly
and and i think from the time it went
public till now it's
north of a 10 000 bagger
you know
every dollar you invested is worth more
than ten thousand dollars not a not a
ten bag or a hundred bagger
like a ten thousand plus bagger
and
why did mcdonald's do so well
it did well because
in the early days when when it got going
there were a number of initiatives a
number of innovations that mcdonald's
had come up with some of you might have
seen the movie the founder
i think the founders i think it's on
netflix i'm not sure if it's on netflix
in india but you might want to you know
i think it's a very good movie to see
there's also a
biography that got written on mcdonald's
called grinding it out it's also a good
book it's a very old book but it's a
great book to read there's another
there's another book which was written
by the
the first ceo of burger king
it's called the burger king and that's
actually an amazing book as well
but basically one of the early
innovations mcdonald's came up with
was that everything they sold could be
eaten
without a fork or a spoon
or a knife there was no
cutlery needed
to you know french fries you could just
take it from your hand and so on the
other thing the other big innovation was
that it was served really fast
you know the the production time and
actually if you really study mcdonald's
internal processes and how it functions
it's kind of like a light manufacturing
type operation the software and engines
they use
internally is like what you would use in
a light manufacturing operation and of
course like for example they were very
specific about the way the french fries
should be
with the russell potatoes so in fact
like for example when mcdonald's enters
a new country like india or russia etc
it takes them two or three years
from the time they decide to enter to
the time they can open their first
restaurant
because it takes a couple of years to
train the farmers and generate the
supply chain
for the right kind of potatoes and such
so it takes takes them sometimes
more than a couple of years just to open
the restaurants and such
but the interesting thing about
something like mcdonald's is that almost
all the innovations they came up with
there were a lot of copycats
and there were many businesses that came
up that
cloned or tried to clone
what they were doing
and
in general fast food became a huge
industry with many players it wasn't
just burgers you know we then got a big
kind of growth in pizzas
chicken
kfc so you know a lot of different
entrants came in and also i think the
on the consumer side it also changed in
terms of what the frequency people were
looking to eat all of this stuff but
anyway even with all of that competition
mcdonald's was able to establish a brand
people knew before they went into a
restaurant any
mcdonald's what to expect the kind of
standardization and
you know consistency the cleanliness the
consistency and and the nature of the
service
worked
so that particular moat has been going
strong for 60 years
there aren't really any signs that say
that
the moat is eroding
and
may not do so well in the future they
couldn't do well and it's a high it's a
very high return on equity business
so
basically
if you think about a franchised
mcdonald's
where you know an entrepreneur
you know
you know does a contract with the
mcdonald corporation
so in a franchise situation
in the united states at least a lot of
the real estate
is owned by the mcdonald's corporation
and the rent the rent that is charged to
the franchisee
is a percentage of sales like maybe
around four percent of sales is the rent
so if you think about the rent
that mcdonald's charges its franchisees
it's kind of automatically inflation
indexed
you know just goes up with inflation
they also charge a franchise fee
you know for the right to use the brand
etc that might be another
four percent or so and then the
franchisees also buy
a lot of the products they need from
mcdonald's and usually on mcdonald's and
a lot of the other franchise type
operations will do is they tend not to
focus on making money on the products
uh they tend to focus on you know
passing that through
but you have the two main engines of the
franchise fees and the
rent
which might be something like seven
eight percent
off the top line
so if you look at it from the mcdonald
corporation's point of view
a typical mcdonald's in the u.s
might have something like two or three
million
in annual sales
and
the mcdonald's corporation might get
something like you know 150 200 000 a
year
from that
from that location
the capital they have to put up against
that
is almost non-existent because it's the
entrepreneur who's you know
paying for all the capex and the
maintenance capex and all of that so
it's a very capital light
business
so
the
the three
legs that we need
you know i think chuck akery called it
the three-legged stool
the three legs that we need for these
long multibaggers
is first of all the
core economics of the business
should have very high returns on
invested capital
ideally without the use of use of debt
right so you basically
make like mcdonald's doesn't need to
borrow money to make a lot of money
the second is that we want very high
integrity management
and we want insider ownership you know
kind of alignment of interest where
there's a
smart entrepreneur or someone or
insiders who own it so they've got
incentives
and the third is that we want a very
long runway
so where we can see that this thing can
go on for a very long time
and
i think that when we
you know if you were to pick up
the
annual report
of let's say walmart
for example walmart went public i think
in
1972 or something it's like been public
for like 50 years if you picked up the
annual report of walmart let's say in
1980 for example a few years seven eight
years
after they went public
you would see that
they've got
very superior economics
at the store level
that they generate high returns on
equity it's it's a business that does
well very very rapid turnover inventory
and so on and you would also see
that it was embryonic in the sense that
large portions of the united states at
that time 1980
still did not have a walmart
for most people you could not get to a
walmart
within
you know 10-15 kilometers of your home
so
you could see that basically this
business could actually if we just
looked at it in north america there was
a lot of room to grow
and what we've seen with mcdonald's is
that it our walmart is that it wasn't
just
a u.s story
you know it was a global store
so walmart has you know opened up in
other countries and done well and you
know we could look at other
other businesses like let's say the
coca-cola company
you know the cocoa company
was formed about a hundred and
years ago
and
that moat is still growing
after 130 years and again the unit
economics
are extremely attractive because the
coca-cola company typically doesn't do
bottling
they sell the
syrup so they have you know these plants
which sell
they don't even sell the syrup they sell
syrup concentrate so basically
it's almost like a software business
where you know if you're
if you're spending
five or ten rupees on a
on a coke
coca-cola company might get like eight
percent of that
and they don't have very little cost
against that so again it's it's very
similar to mcdonald's in terms of uh in
terms of economics so basically there
are there are businesses different kinds
of businesses you can look at a business
like mastercard
or visa or american express and they
have similar attributes where
you have very high returns on invested
capital you have a very long runway
and you have high integrity management
inside ownership and so on so if one
pursues these now
you know the nature of capitalism is
that everyone wants to own these kinds
of businesses once
these
kind of moats and you know runways
etc are well known
the businesses get priced to perfection
and
they may not be available
at a cheap price
and so for example
if we look at a business in india
like dmart for example
and dmart you know
similar model to costco and
aldi
outside india
and dmard is very embryonic
today there's very few dmarch stores
in india relative to what could possibly
be
their penetrations in 10 20 or 30 years
but the market
recognizes that and so dmr trades at you
know huge multiples
uh
it doesn't appear
optically cheap but the interesting
thing is that
if the runways are really long and
they actually end up being
runways that go on for you know several
decades
then even an expensive looking price
can
end up being
a great value investment
but
but i think that as
as value investors you know we have to
also
have a good dose of skepticism
in
in how we approach these things so
we can't always assume that you know
everything's going to go to the moon in
terms of
terms of size and growth
and the nature of capitalism is that
there will be a lot of competition that
will try to
go up against those modes
but but i think that i think that if you
know there's a uh
there's a
quote from the upanishads
which goes something like this
as is your wish
so is your will
as is your will
so is your deed
and as is your deed
so is your destiny
and then kind of the punchline is your
deepest desire
is your destiny
so
going back you know to what i started
with you know if you said i want to
focus on
50 cent dollar bills
and that's your deepest desire
you will find those if it's
if you say i want 20 cent dollar bills
you will find those two
if you say that i only want to invest in
businesses that can go up 100 times
in value
in 10 20 30 years
you can find those too
so
it's a matter of what you choose to
focus on and as long as you're willing
to put in the work
to sift through company after company
you know with the framework that you're
interested in so
in in the case of the multibagger
framework
there are just three things
that matter
and then the fourth is the price
obviously so
if a business doesn't generate high
returns of equity
you're done you don't need to
spend any time on that
if the business needs a lot of debt
to
grow and generate higher returns and
equity you would also be done you don't
even need those
if management
quality or
ethics is a question
you're also done
you don't need those either
and so
just just if you look at the businesses
that generate high returns and equity
that alone would wipe out large swaths
of businesses
and then you know you get to the runway
right so
dmart
will be a lot larger in 10 or 15 15
years than it is today
i think that's a pretty easy bet to make
that the statistically i think the odds
are high that something like dmart might
do well we could make that statement
about private sector banks in india
you know private sector banks in india
might be like
a third of the
banking pie
in india today and maybe in 10 or 20
years it might be
half or two thirds of the pie for
example and the pie itself would have
grown so
there are there are things that
we could
hang our hat on and then kind of take it
from there
so
basically i think that if you if you go
down this path which is the multibagger
path
the interesting thing is that
and and all all value investing
there are a couple of data points you
know john templeton used to say that the
very best value investor or analyst
will be wrong one out of three times
like
33 error rate
is the lowest error rate for the very
best
practitioner of the art
if you were a kind of brain surgeon
and you had even a three percent error
rate there might not be too many people
coming to you for brain surgery but i
think in terms of value investing
you could be wrong half the time
and i think i've probably been wrong
close to half the time
and still end up with a phenomenal track
record
so
and especially if you focus on the
multibaggers
you know companies that would go up 10x
or 100x
basically in a lifetime of investing
if you end up ended up finding just two
or three or four
hundred baggers
at the age that you're at right now
that's all you need
in many cases if you just found one
that might be all you need
and so we have all this time
and on the other end we just need to
find
things
just once
don't even need to find them that many
times
when i started investing
started my journey value investing
about 27 years ago 94 95.
in the first in the first five years
when i was not running my funds i was
just running
my own money i started with about one
million dollars
in 95.
by the time
in the first five years
i had had uh
200 baggers
in the first five years itself
and then i think from
2000
to
2022 now
i haven't had any 100
but i think that there might be some
more
in the future some that are kind of you
know still
hopefully going through their their
journey
so so you don't need
you don't need very many of them
uh a few of them can get you to the
promised land
and
i've had i would say i've had when i
look back
a rather sloppy journey
as an investor because i was trying all
these different things if
i think if in 94 or 95 had
done what i am telling you to do now or
suggesting what you should do now
i think i would have done a lot better
than how i've done so if i had purely
focused
10 or 100 baggers
i think i think the results would be
vastly better
i remember in 95 january 95 when i had
the one million dollars i'd mostly
invested in the u.s markets
but i had a interest in the indian
markets as well
and i thought there were two or three
areas
where it could do well
and
i decided to put 20 000 out of the one
million dollars just just two percent of
the portfolio
into india at that time and i opened a
uh brokerage account uh
and so just my own monies opened nre
brokerage account with kotak
i decided to put half that money ten
thousand dollars in one stock which was
a it company
and i was in the i was in the i.t
services business at the time so i know
i knew this business really well satyam
computers which at that time actually
was a pretty honest company they
kind of went wayward i think in terms of
their ethics about 10-12 years after
that
but in 95 they were a clean company
so i put 10 000 to satyam and uh in 95
and i think by the time it was 2000
it had gone up
150x the 10 000 would become one and a
half million dollars approximately 1.4
million or something
and then the remaining 10 000
i
put into three other stocks
i bought two of the courier companies
that were listed in india at the time
blue dart and skypac courier
because my perspective was that the
indian postal service was just host
and if you really wanted to get a
package from point a to point b in india
you really had to rely on
private people to get it for you i don't
think the postal service was reliable
and so i thought that these businesses
that were focused on that would do quite
well
so i was just going to make three
investments actually uh half and satyam
and then half in these other two
and then at the last minute i was also
very impressed with kotak because i was
just very impressed in dealing with
their people
and so i decided to split the other ten
thousand three ways you know one
about thirty two thirty three hundred in
kotak and
thirty three hundred to the other two
businesses
so when this 10 000 became 1.4 million
or whatever
uh in 2000 the other three businesses
had done nothing
for five years it was pretty much
sitting
close to what i had paid for them like
no movement for the most part
it is not
realistic to think that
if you put 20 000 in the indian market
and you get
you know
1.4 million something like a 70x
that you there's still some meat on that
bone and there's stint some juice to be
extracted if you will so i said this is
a pretty good result
and for no really good reason
in 2000 i sold the other three stocks
and i told kotak you know sell these
stocks and just send me the
money back i basically liquidated the
entire indian portfolio in 2000. there
was no there was no really good reason
to sell blue dart or skype or kota
no particular reason that uh
i had to do that
kotak from 2000 till now
is about a 500x
blue dot is about a 300 x
sky pack went kind of backwards i think
eventually went bankrupt but it was down
like 90 or something
so basically there were
massive home runs there were two massive
home runs which
like i said i
there was no reason to kind of make that
decision to sell but that's what
happened and you know i
missed those two rides
but even with these sloppy nature
and kind of stupid analysis that i did
in those cell decisions
the end result was fine and the
remaining 980 000 that had invested in
the us
over the next four five years by 99 2000
it was about 13
million or so
so that had gone up quite a bit because
one of those one of those bets had gone
up 100 x
100 000 became about 10 million or so
so anyway the thing is that even with a
lot of sloppiness what i'm saying is
that basically what
what when you look at that investing
that took place then
just the two bets
that were 100 bagger
were responsible for like 80 90 of the
returns it didn't matter the rest didn't
matter if it all went to zero the
results were still been great
and so that's the nature of this
multi-bagger type investing
is that
it can tolerate a very high
error rate
and of course your your objective as an
analyst should be to
try to keep the error rate as low as
possible in 2019
i was visiting istanbul for the second
time and turkish market actually i think
is the
cheapest market in the world
because they've got just a lot of crazy
macro things going on in the country
very high inflation and weird policies
and
everyone's exited and so on in fact
turkey reminds me of
the indian markets maybe in the early
90s or so on
and i
ran into this business
on my second trip in 2019
where the
market cap was 20 million dollars
and the liquidation value was more than
six or seven hundred million dollars
it was actually a dollar bill
trading for three cents
which
i don't think
it never happened to me before then
so in the previous 24 years of investing
that never happened
and i think till i leave planet hurt i
don't think it will happen again
but basically you know if i look at this
business which i bought at you know
three cents on the dollar like the 20
million market cap i
i was surprised with the volumes obry
funds owns one third of that business
and we pretty much got one third of the
business for like
eight million dollars or something if
the business
did not increase in value
at all
but it got to fair value at some point
we would have a 30x return
30 or 33x or something
but now we want the business for what
three years they've actually increased
value of the business quite a bit in the
last three years and it's run by
phenomenal people really good capital
allocators
and i think they will increase the value
of the business quite significantly in
the years ahead
so
having learned my lesson from kotak and
blue dart and so on
the only thing i need to do with this
business
is do nothing
just sit there
and spend time talking to students like
you
so that the time is used up and not used
to sell things
hopefully 20 years from now
we still own that business so
if that business
tripled
in what it's worth the value like you
know was 600 billion million or
something let's say it became 2 billion
we would have 100
and i think it can it can triple its
value in
maybe
five or ten years
and
it can keep going after that i mean the
the two people running it they're not
that old so i think they could they
could keep compounding for a while
and so when i look at kind of that
particular business and it's it's a
small part of the portfolio today it's
gone up i think in the last
three years it's gone up like
five six x or so
so it's gradually moving towards its
its
value and so on
but i'm just saying that the nature of
these hundred daggers is that this
one business could become bigger than
everything else in the portfolio even
though we made such a small bet with it
so with that i think i'll stop there
would love to
hear what you have on your mind we can
talk about what i just talked about or
stuff that isn't related so
thank you uh thank you sir for the
insightful session it was so interesting
to listen uh listen to you uh now we
will open the flow for questions from
the audience those who want to ask that
question can raise their hand uh okay
sonia you may go first
okay uh
uh thank you for this insightful session
uh so
in this uh today we always listen a lot
that uh the value of anything is added
in the modern world so what is your
opinion on this
well you know all intelligent investing
is value investing because we have
so many stocks around the world and
because there are so many things going
on with different companies around the
world
that
you know like this news anchor uh jim
cramer says there's a bull always a bull
market somewhere
so
i think that if one is a investment
analyst and you know
picks through stuff
you will you will find that there are
some parts of the markets and some parts
of the
of the ecosystem that is
appears very overvalued
but you'll also find that there's lots
of things that are hated and unloved
and like for example you know
turkey is hated and unloved so there are
always in in it's in the nature of
auction driven markets
that they will overshoot and undershoot
i mean one one simple
data point you can look at
is
look at the
price of any stock
on the
nsc or bse
and look at the 52-week range on that
stock
you know
it might be
50 to 150
or 100 to 200
or 500 to 1000.
it's a like a
50 100 swing in one year
for almost every stock like all 5000
stocks
right
but
if you look at for
example the cost of an apartment
in mumbai for example you know apartment
in bandra
or some place
and you have a friend who's a broker or
an agent and you go to him every day and
say
what is my flat word
he'll say your flat is worth three
crores
and then you go to him the next day and
say what is my flat work now he'll say
it's still three crores
and then you go to him after one week
and you ask him again what is my flat
word he'll say listen idiot
it's still three crores
and you keep bothering this guy every
day and then maybe after three months he
might say you know it's actually
3.1 crores
you know it has moved a little bit 3.1
crore now i can get you 3.1 crores
and then maybe in six months or eight
months if you keep bothering him and
he's still your friend
every day
maybe it becomes
three point three crores you know in a
year or something
okay possible maybe three and a half
or might go to two and a half you know
the fluctuation rate of that flat
is not going to range between three and
six crores in a year
it's going to be like 2.7 to 3.3 crore
in a very tight band
because
that price is not being set
in an auction format
it is being set with an intelligent
buyer facing an intelligent seller
and when you have intelligent buyers
facing intelligence sellers you get
great practice price discovery
but when you have these you know auction
driven markets which is the nsc or bse
or new york stock exchange
you will get much wider swings
and so if you're in a in in the business
of investing where you are
dealing with auction driven markets
just this phenomena of the 50 swing
means at some point the
stock is mispriced
it has to be at one it has to be either
under price at some point overpriced at
some point
because the real value of the business
cannot change 50 in a year for most
businesses
so
hence we have proved
that there is always value
in
investments and markets
thank you sir
okay we you can ask a question
thanks
for the like my question is essentially
around specifically to india we have a
lot of corporate governance issues
within india so when you are picking
companies how are you filtering out
these companies which have uh
significant corporate governance issues
which an hour later for example
that had massive issues later on so what
kind of filters do you use when you're
investing or picking
yeah so i think i think that yeah i
think your filters need to be stronger
investing in india than i would have in
the us i think that
if i were to invest only in the new york
stock exchange type businesses
the odds that i would lose money because
of fraud
approaches zero
you know i would say if i make 10
investments
all in the new york exchange and i
have a lifetime of investing i do just
in that market
maybe out of you know
50 investments i make in a
40-50 year period
at the most one might be fraudulent
something like that
it would be pretty low number in india
if i did the same thing i think the
number would be higher
but i think the
that given that we
already know that
that the ethos levels of
let's say managers or managements in
india may be somewhat lower
than the ethos level of a typical nyc
comp listed company
we can adjust for that
so there are plenty of businesses in
india
where
one can
reach a fairly
decent conclusion
that the ethics and ethos of the
business and the owners is high
and there may be a lot of businesses
where we may not be able to make that
determination
so
if we either know that ethics is low or
governance has issues or
we're not able to figure it out
you just take a pass on those businesses
just like you would take a pass on a low
return equity business
you know it could be very ethical but
return equity is low
because there's 5 000 listed companies
you still end up in a decent universe
to look at so i think i think if you if
you set up rigorous filters
for ethics
it may not be foolproof but you can
reduce the error rate
okay but you can ask your question
thank you for your great session
uh myself uh my question is that how
what is your strategy in identifying and
valuing a company and how do you
identify your first talk is overvalued
or undervalued
yeah so i think that
i think if a business is within your
circle of competence
i mean
let's
let's take uh the example of a business
like dmart for example
and let's say i have not looked at dmart
recently but let's say for example a
trailing pe basis is trading at 100
times earnings
which you know it used to trade it or
maybe still trading it something like
that
if one understood the business and one
had a good view
of what the cash flows of the business
are over the next 10 or 20 years you can
discount those cash flows back
and then that would tell you whether the
business is overvalued or undervalued it
would just be a straight math exercise
so
and if you are
not able to estimate those cash flows
then i think there's no basis on which
you could make an investment like that
so you would take a pass in that
particular case
the first
question to ask yourself is
do i understand the business
and is the business within my circle of
competence and if you understand the
business
and the business is within your circle
of competence then by definition you
know
with some boundaries what the future of
the business is likely to look like
and what the trajectory is like to look
at what the cash flows are like likely
to look like and i think if you can put
some boundaries around that
then you have a basis to make an
investment
in
in 2015
an indian guy living in vancouver canada
his name is parry pasricha
he had sent me i didn't know him
he sent me a write-up
of a company based in hyderabad called
rain industries
and
basically at that time
uh you know the extremely well-written
write-up like 20-page pdf it's actually
i think that write-up is floating on the
internet so i think if you if you just
google like very persuasion industry
probably that pdf will pull up
there's another guy luca franca who had
done a
report on reign and i think that's also
in the internet somewhere that was done
before perry did his report but
basically the
situation that
perry was bringing up in that
report
was that rain was
trading at i think 35 rupees a share at
that time
about a you know
170 or 180 million market cap at that
time
with about two billion dollars in
revenue it was trading at about one
tenth of
sales
the price to sales ratio was 0.1
uh it seemed very likely that
in the next four or five years
in a single year rain's earnings would
be over 35 rupees a share
so
when i looked at rain it's a very
cyclical business it has a lot of
gyrations a lot of issues with it
but it was
extremely cheap
in effect it was trading at a future peo
one
i couldn't find anything wrong with it
so
i made i made a bet on rain industries
and as a foreign investor we could only
buy 9.99
and so we bought 9.99 percent of the
business for i think 20 million dollars
by less than three years after we bought
in early 2018 late 2017
it was trading at over 400 rupees a
share
so my my thesis when i originally
invested was that i think i thought
i just want to own this business when
the earnings are 35 rupees
and i just want to see what the market
would do with the price of the stock
when the earnings are 35 rupees a share
i just want to see if it actually sits
at 35 rupees at that point
and which i didn't think was possible
but i just wanted to see what happened
so this was just a pure math game
and of course when the earnings i think
their earnings were coming to close to
10 rupees a quarter when they were
approaching
9 or 10 rupees a quarter the stock went
to like 440 rupees
and of course by that time i had fallen
madly in love with rain and it's great
management and
they're very high ethics and
very very
honest competent operators i said no
this is a this is a far better business
than i thought it is and you know we
shouldn't
get off the bus so quickly you know all
most of the time i probably didn't get
off the bus too quickly
so
rain went from 35 rupees in 2015
to 440 rupees in early 2018
to 60 rupees in
march of 2020 when covet hit
to about
160 or 170 rupees currently
okay
and we still own it
right
but even if you take the current
situation you know with a 160 or
something in in rupees it's like a
4x in seven years for example
and
you know we think it'll do better and be
worth more in the future so i think in
that case you know like i said
it's it's like we i couldn't i don't i
still don't have a crystal ball
on reign of what
next 10 years of cash flows would be
that's i think impossible to estimate
but i think the fact that we would make
money on that investment was a very high
probability
uh certain interest of time
can we take two or three more questions
sure
yeah keep going
yeah rajat you may ask your question
first
thank you sir for sharing your wisdom on
value investing in public auction
markets
uh my question digresses a bit it is for
the private markets venture capital in
particular
i want to understand what parameters
will you employ for investing in early
stage startups from a value investing
lens in the context of a where price
discovery as you mentioned is ambiguous
b given the current news of funding
winter and the capital drying up
yeah i mean i think that i'm probably
not the right person to ask that
question to i think the
the closer you go towards the formation
date of a business
uh and then try to extrapolate the
future of that
business the more murky it becomes
so the the venture capital game is a
very different game in the sense that
you are expecting most of your returns
to come from
one or two
bets in the fund for example
and you're expecting
80 90
of the fund may a lot of those
investments may go by the wayside
or may not do much long term so
basically it's a very different game i
think it's very hard to get downside
protection
in the venture game
and i think it's very hard to
do these
future cash flow projections and all of
that because we just don't have the
trademarks we don't have the
the historical trend mark so
it's it's not something that
i think i have expertise and the other
thing about the venture business is that
if we look at the statistics you know so
in in silicon valley which has had a
very long history of venture capital
the venture funds that have let's say
the top 10 percent you know their
annualized returns and the top 10
percent of venture funds
their returns are
multiples of so you know the top
quartile funds
have done much much better than the
bottom quartile funds
and if you do the same thing with bond
funds for example
the difference between a top quartile
bond fund and a bottom quartile bond
fund may be almost non-existent
might be like 100 basis points or 200
basis points would be a very very small
difference
so what i'm saying is that
the ability to add alpha
in a bond fund is very limited
and
if we if we look at a if we look at a
fund like you know sequoyah fund or
andreessen aurovitz
or y combinator etc
they have an advantage they have
multiple advantages but one of the big
advantages they have
is deal flow
so
i have some friends and you know some of
my investors are venture capitalists in
silicon valley
they say to me that if we had access
to the trash can of sequoia
our returns would be 3x what they are so
if he said if we could just look at
every deal
that sequoia turned down
we would do 3x better because they said
we just don't get to see
you know so deal flow so one of the one
of the things about the public markets
is
the small investor actually has a huge
advantage over the institutional
investor
an institutional investor with you know
hundreds of millions or billions of
dollars
cannot look at small investments
they just they have to put large amounts
of money to work at a time a small
investor having
you know five crores to invest or
50 lakhs to invest
10 lakhs to invest can look at
everything you can look at nano caps can
look at everything
and so their universe is much wider and
they can be a lot more picky in terms of
where they put their money
so
in the public markets the small investor
has a huge advantage
in the venture market a small investor
or an unknown investor with no
no access to real deal flow
is at a huge disadvantage
so
my conclusion when i look at all of that
is it's not a game where the odds are in
my favor
and so i have chosen
not to play in that area and i think the
kinds of questions you're asking
i think are very difficult questions to
answer
thank you
in the interest of time we will take
only last two questions uh beyonce you
may go you may go you can go first i
don't know if the others can hear you or
not but i can barely hear you but
okay go ahead will try i put my question
in the chat box if that will happen
yeah i think i think for a know nothing
investor
passive index investing is a great way
to go
especially if you have you know many
decades of time and you're young and so
on
i think index investing does well the
frictional costs are low and such
if you have a view and you understand
certain businesses you understand
they're undervalued
and and so on
then i think you could actually you know
pick stocks and so on but i would say
starting baseline
being a passive investor is certainly a
great way to go for most people
next
sure
thank you thank you sir for an
insightful
session so my question is very simple so
when we look at value investing which
was being
propagated by say the likes of ben
graham we did not have
the modern situation right and a of a
negative usual reach for a longer period
of time
but then liquidity both absolute and
relative so
do you think that probably sticking to
that value investing
may result in uh risking probably
figuring out who the future winners
could be or simply put uh probably what
would you change
in value investing which has been taught
or which has been
learned to something which would be more
relevant in a current context
yeah i think it's a good question so i
think that most investors would be
better off
completely ignored everything macro
so for example
if if i had a viewpoint
of
kind of
what would happen to starbucks
20 years ago
it really doesn't matter what the rates
are and the fed is doing and what you
know what
financial crisis is happening or
whatever else has happened at the core
the starbucks business is such that when
they open a store in the u.s
they get their money back in two years
35 return on capital
they don't franchise any stores
and when they open a store in china they
get their money back in 15 months
like something like 70 return on capital
and
i mean they have found for example that
if they have one store in manhattan in a
particular intersection and they put
another store diagonal from that store
it doesn't even cannibalize the first
store when the second store is so close
and such so it's an it's an incredible
business so i think that if one
focuses on understanding the business
and is able to identify
great businesses
that should be where the focus is
when i made the investment in turkey in
this in this
business
it was completely irrelevant to me what
was happening on the macro front i mean
turkey inflation rates are crazy and
the way they deal with the currency is
crazy but i was i could look at that
business and see that these things would
not really matter
in terms of our returns and basically
when i made the investment in that
business
one dollar was five lira
you know five leader could get you one
dollar
now it is almost 18 lira to get one
dollar
so i have
suffered incredible devaluation but in
dollar terms
we are up for x
in lira terms we are up infinite x
but who cares about that so what i'm
saying is that we had extreme headwinds
uh macro headwinds when we went in
didn't care about it and it didn't
matter
so i think it's it's very important to
be right on the business if you were
early on mcdonald's and
walmart or any of these you know
mastercard visa whatever
uh coke and so on i think the thing is
that
you know some of these
you know long runways
they will transcend everything that's
the key is can you find these great
businesses can you find them early
enough can you buy them at
decent prices and then can you be
patient
through thick and thin
sure that's that's why
there's a
there's a investment bank in
nariman point enam
most of you will be familiar with imam
you know they took infosys public
and when they took infosys public they
were having difficulty placing the stock
you know they were the underwriter they
were left with stock that
nobody was willing to buy
enam kept the stock for themselves
until pretty recently they kept most of
those shares i think they may have
they may have
reduced or eliminated the position now
or it's a small much smaller position
but basically
it doesn't matter what else inarm did
in the last
30 years
it's irrelevant what they did in the
last 30 years
90 percent of the
value of that firm
was based on whether or not they kept
that infosys stock that nobody wanted
and so it's a good business they're
great people and they're smart people
but one decision
you know trumps all the other decisions
and if they had sold infosys or they had
found a lot of people willing to buy it
i think inam would be a shadow of itself
where it is today so you know it's just
small small things like that create
huge deltas in where things end up
thank you thank you so much sir
sir can we take up one last question by
pawn if time permits you
of course yes but when you can ask your
question uh thank you so much sir and
thanks a lot for your wisdom sir today
so my question is regarding multibaggers
as we discussed so during our holding
period of say 10 15 20 odd years
we see
drawdowns of over north of like 50
percent sometimes even 90 percent during
the 10 year investment 10 years so how
do you deal with that situation
and it often arises when you are holding
for such a long period of time
especially for multivitamins
yeah so
conviction is really important
and
how do you get conviction
i mean i think i think you get
conviction
because
you
have a very strong understanding of the
business
so
if i
if i go back to the
business in turkey for example
basically you know that business has a
number of different business lines but
the one that has the most value today
is they have 12 million square feet of
prime warehouse space in turkey it is
mostly in istanbul
and
that 12 million square feet
has a value today you know you could go
to a broker he will tell you that
you can sell the whole thing and you
will probably get a billion dollars for
it something like that billion billion
two or something
there's only about 100 million 80
million of debt
so if you just liquidate that entire
position you'll get about maybe 900
million dollars or something
and
you know so
what is the warehouse
so warehouse is land concrete
steel
some 20 is refrigerated so you have some
refrigerated units and all that
all of these things are
going to increase in value if you have
inflation
so steel price is going to go up because
it's going to
it's going to
track international steel prices
concrete and cement prices will track
international concrete and ceramic
prices and land also has prime land and
a prime you know major city in the world
has a value
and so
when i invested the value per square
foot was about eighty dollars a square
foot for land and
improvements
and i don't think that 80 is going
anywhere you know
it it may be 200 a square foot at some
point but it will not go to 30 square
foot that won't happen
so
so i don't care about anything else
that's going on that is the piece that
is the most important it's 99 lease it's
10 years inflation index
leases and all of that so conviction is
really important right so if you
if you invested in starbucks
you would have two or three things that
you understand you would understand the
unit economics that when they open a
store
they get their money back in one or two
years you would understand that
if that suddenly changed where it was
taking five years or ten years to get
your money back when you open a new
store
something has changed
right that's a significant change if
that looks like a secular permanent
change
the thesis has changed
but if you if it continues to be very
high returns on capital
the second is you would have had some
perspective on the runway
where you say okay
it has 5000 stores around the world for
example it probably has more than that
right now but
at 20 years from now i think it can
easily be 25 000 stores for example
and if you have conviction on that then
you know you the two pieces that really
matter is that what are the unit
economics and what is the store count
you know and those are really the pieces
that matter
and so
when you make an investment in a stock
you should be able to
explain the thesis of that investor
investment in five or ten sentences
to a ten-year-old
without a spreadsheet and without
anything
okay
and this is why this makes sense
and that
gives you the conviction if you have to
go look at a spreadsheet or look at
something
to then you know when price drop 50 to
understand what is going on
you have not done your homework
so
it needs to get down when you've done
all the work to simplicity
you know it can take a long time to get
to those essence
of these businesses
but it needs to get to the essence of
those businesses so you have to get to
understanding
why is this business resilient why will
it be around 10 years from now
and why will the
economics and the return on equity and
all of that still be high
why will all those things be true
so we aren't particularly concerned with
price movements
we are concerned with
the
expansion or shrinkage of the moon
if the mote goes through a secular
decline we have a problem
the quoted price changing is not
relevant
sir thank you so
much thank you so much sir for your
insights before we conclude this amazing
session sbm nmims would like to extend a
heartfelt thanks to mr monis fabry for
sparing his valuable time to grace this
event and enlighten us with some really
practical practical and usable words of
wisdom we would also like to extend our
gratitude to all the attendees for their
unabated attention to our event and for
some really good questions we definitely
have something to take back home what
was more intriguing for us was how you
identify stocks whether it is through
chalk acres three-legged stool which can
become multibagger for example
mcdonald's coca-cola etc and i'm very
sure if we replicate this approach we
can make money for ourselves
if knowledge is power then curiosity is
the muscle let's keep up this curiosity
forever
on the on that note we reached the end
of the session have a great day everyone
thank you and i would just uh i would
just like to say that i think you guys
are
the cream of the crop of india you are
the future of india you're at a great
institution
and you guys will do
really well in the decades ahead
in whatever becomes your
eventual you know career pursuit
so uh i think you already kind of won
the lottery if you will
so the world is your oyster and
congratulations
thank you sir
all right
